- **Implement Server Logic**
  - Set up a basic WebSocket server that listens for connections.
  - Manage a list of connected clients.
  - Broadcast messages received from one client to all others.
  - Handle player join and leave events to update the lobby player count.

### Implementing Collision Detection

- **Modify Player Movement**
  - In `Player.js`, before updating the player's position, check the target cell in the `Map` grid.
  - If the cell is a wall, block, or contains a bomb, prevent movement.
  - Update the `move()` method accordingly.

- **Update Map State**
  - Ensure that the `Map` class accurately reflects the current state of the grid.
  - When a player moves, update the `hasPlayer` property of the relevant cells.

  - Add an event listener for the Spacebar in `Player.js`.
  - When pressed, call the `placeBomb()` method.
  - Check if the player has bombs available before placing.

- **Update Explosion Logic**
  - In `Bomb.js`, adjust the `explode()` method to:
    - Affect players caught in the explosion.
    - Trigger other bombs within the explosion range.
    - Remove destroyed blocks from the map and update the grid.

### Adding Visual Enhancements

- **Integrate Sprites**
  - Replace CSS background colors with image backgrounds.
  - Update styles in `style.css` to use `background-image` properties.
  - Ensure images are properly sized and positioned.

- **Implement Animations**
